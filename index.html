        <p class="text-animation">
          Make sure to pack up enough water before going hiking or trekking.
          It's easy to underestimate how much you'll need for the trip so bring
          extra water just to be safe to prevent dehydration.

        <p class="text-animation">
          Be careful not to get too cold. Make sure to keep warm and stay at the
          right temperature. In the case of that emergency make sure to bring
          warm clothing to stay heated to prevent that problem from happening in
          the first place.

        <p class="text-animation">
          The heat can be quite intense. Make sure to pack up some sunscreens to
          prevent sunburns while you're hiking or trekking while also trying to
          stay in areas where the heat doesn't affect you too much.

        <i class="fas fa-hiking icons"></i>
        <p class="text-animation">
          Make sure to bring enough supplies such as food, water, and extra
          clothing for lengthy hiking or trekking trips. It's always good to
          stock up a bit more than required to be safe and for cases of
          emergency.
